A basic sentiment analysis project developed as neural network classfication model using keras and tensorflow.

This model uses the IMDB reviews dataset provided by keras. 
The dataset consists of 50000 reviews with 25000 reviews as training data and another 25000 as test data. The trained model predicts whether the review is postive or negative.
The trained model attained an accuracy of 86.7%
